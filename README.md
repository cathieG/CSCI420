# CSCI420: Movie Sentiment Detection Model



# **Overview** 
This project, completed as the final assignment for CSCI 420-04: Understanding Large Language Models, explores the use of LLMs for sentiment classification on movie reviewsâ€”a foundational task in natural language processing. I employed ALBERT, a lightweight Transformer model, as the baseline and fine-tuned it using the IMDb dataset sourced from Hugging Face. My training data consisted of 20,000 labeled reviews, and the testing data 5,000. The baseline model achieved an accuracy of 0.5014, while the fine-tuned model significantly improved performance with an accuracy of 0.9410. Full implementation details, training configurations, and evaluation metrics are provided in the accompanying report.pdf.
